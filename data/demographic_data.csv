However, this is also one of my primary concerns with this type of interview process. There's no way to ask questions in real time, and one would have to jot down their questions as they arose when answering their questions. It could also cause confusion— does the applicant reach out with these questions immediately after their interview is submitted? Does this opportunity occur only after the company has decided to proceed to the next stage of the interview process with you? Or do they transition to an instant two-way style communication method only after you're offered a job? Additionally, some possible return questions could make an applicant feel awkward or wary of writing them in an email to their HR department— such as salary negotiation, workplace moral and environment, etc. Body language is a hugely important factor in feeling you've received a truthful response to these type of questions. In a live interview, you're able to get a feel of what the interviewee is truly saying, an unspoken language, where the choice of words used do not carry as much weight as the ones unsaid. While there are benefits to the offline, self-paced interview, it can also seem a bit cold... an applicant could feel like they're just one of the masses, not important enough for an employee to take the time to sit down and conduct it in person. It would leave me questioning the company's true intentions towards possibly hiring me— are they actively acknowledging the worth of my candidacy and what I would provide to their company? Are they wanting ME or are they just looking for someone to fill the open spot? Intention makes all the difference. ""Go where you're wanted, not tolerated!""

","Yes.",""
"National Geographic wildlife photographer / journalist ","Female","White","19","Student","Some college, but no degree","Somewhat familiar","Yes","Somewhat familiar","The fact that artificial intelligence was rating my interview and judging my responses rather than another human being in real time. ","Personally, no. ","Artificial intelligence does not have the same judging capacity as a human would in real time. Technology isn't this evolved yet in my opinion, which would dissatisfy me. ","Everything was explained in clear detail in a way that made sense. ","None to me.","I would specify what exactly you're looking for after the hypothetical interviews are posed in the areas where you can choose strongly agree to strongly disagree. ","Yes- both these scenarios are very real-life and very possible. ",""
"I want to be a Graphic Designer or Creative Director","Female","White","19","Unemployed looking for work,Student","Some college, but no degree","Somewhat familiar","No","Somewhat familiar","The bias presented both in the in-person interview and even in the AI interview, how am I to know if my answers are being accurately scored?","Yes, being a woman, that identity could be looked down upon if I am assumed not right for the job based off of that.","Because it is not necessarily how I would be working in real life.","Yes, it made sense to me and I felt as though I was actually answering a question about something I have done before.","None","The length or make it about a specific job so the questions can be answered more accurately.","I would experience both, but prefer human interaction.",""
"Therapist","Female","White","20","Student","Some college, but no degree","Familiar","Yes","Familiar","The AI interview would make me wonder how well the program would understand and ""grade"" my answers. With a person interviewing me I would feel more understood and less afraid of technical error. However with the human, I could be judged (subconsciously or purposefully) for how I looked.","I don't think any of my identities could be threatened, however, I know there are people who's identities could be threatened by human judgement.","The AI was an accurate assessment of my ability however, it allowed me to change my answer and have more time to formulate a better answer than the human interview. The human interview assessed my ability to quickly think of answers (which may have lead to more honest and/or worse answers)","The process made perfect sense. I would not change anything","None","I would not change anything","I think there is a chance I will encounter both.

"Musician","Male","White","20","Employed part time,Student","Some college, but no degree","Familiar","Yes","Familiar","If I was hypothetically ""interviewing"" to be a musician (however that would be, my dream job doesn't really apply to this survey), doing so over a video call would be pointless.","Yes","Unless the ""interview"" was an audition for a band in person, it's not going to be able to accurately assess my abilities as a musician. Again, this survey doesn't really apply to my dream job.","No. You need to make it clear from the question asking about the dream job that it's a company job. This doesn't apply to people that would work in jobs that are separate from companies (i.e. being a musician).","N/A","I wish I would've known it was talking about a company job as opposed to any dream job. There's so many possibilities for jobs that are separate from companies, such as someone wanting to, again, be a musician or maybe even a freelance photographer. An interview with a company makes no sense for these.","No.","Again, not relevant to people not wanting to work at a company."
